# Documentation for the AUDIOPHILE Project.

## contributing to this project.

#### 1. clone the repo to you local machine
#### 2. The default branch is the ``main`` branch, that is the branch that will go to production, each PR raised will be merged to the ``develop`` branch. So after clonning the repository make sure to first create your own ``branch``, the branch should be named after what ``ticket`` or ``issue`` you are working on.
#### 3. When commiting, for uniformity sake your ``commit message`` should follow this pattern ``git commit -m "Issue #issueNumber or name" ``. e.g if my issue number #123 or name is #loggin, mt commit message will look like this ``git commit -m "Issue #123 or #logging" ``. This will ensure uniformity and will make tracking easy.

## Note:
  ### Any PR that doesnt conform to the parttern stated above will not be attended to.

## Project Work Flow.

#### Each member of the team will be assigned a ticket, this tiket will contain the task description inform of a ``user story``, ticket name or number ``(issue name or number)`` and duration.
#### When assigned with a ticket, and you have started working on it, you are to move the ticket to ``in progress``.
#### When you are done with the tickect, move it from ``in porgress`` to ``done``, attach the PR link and live link if possible to such ticket for testing and review sake. The PM will comment on it when done reviewing and testing.
#### If the duration of a ticket expires before you are done, it is expected of you to request for addition time of not more than ``24 hours`` with a cogent reason.
